Hi! Thank you for the opportunity to work on this simple task. I wanted to mention that I had a small doubt about how to filter the albums. I wasn't entirely sure if I should display all the albums from the artist "Jack Johnson" only or include albums associated with other artists as well, like "Jack Johnson and Friends". So, in the code, I didn't filter by the "artistName" and left the code commented for future reference.

Additionally, I added a simple splash screen to enhance the user experience.

Cheers,
Diogo
